# Predicting-NCAA-Men-s-Basketball-Outcomes-with-Trivial-Factors
## Description
When predicting who is going to win a basketball game, many look towards the clear factors such as shooting percentage, defensive formations, rebounding skill, etc. But what if there were different factors that impacted the chances a team has to win? Our team was wondering that exact same question and put it to the test. For our project we sought to discover such factors.
## Process
Trivial data such as school attendance, basketball program budget, and more was collected from various sources. All of this data was compiled into a single data set to be used for predicting the win/loss outcomes of NCAA Men's basketball games. Traditional basketball data was also collected such as avg points, avg rebounds, etc. so that there is a baseline to compare the trivial data to. The created data sets were cleaned, and the Random Forests machine learning algorithm was applied in order to make accurate predictions based on the trivial data. This algortihm was best suited for this project since the trivial data points lack in correlation which may be harder for other algorithms to find correlations between the data points.
